            <h3>Then and now</h3>
            <p>Hoobastank, originally known as Hoobustank, is an American rock band formed in 1994 in Agoura
                Hills, California, by lead vocalist Doug Robb, guitarist Dan Estrin, drummer Chris Hesse, and
                original bassist Markku Lappalainen. They were signed to Island Records from 2001 to 2012 and
                have released six albums and one extended play to date. Their most recent album, Push Pull, was
                released on May 25, 2018. They have sold 10 million albums worldwide. The band is best known for
                their biggest hit single, "The Reason".</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>The musical evolution</h3>
            <p>Hoobastank has been categorized under genres such as post-grunge,alternative rock, hard rock, and
                nu metal, On their early independent releases, the band used a funk metal and ska punk sound and
                had a saxophonist in the band. On their major-label, self-titled, debut album, the band's sound
                changed; they removed their saxophonist and became a four-piece rock band, using an alternative
                rock sound. The band's sound matured in their second album, The Reason, and became more melodic.

            <h3>Fame point - The Reason (2003-2005)</h3>
            <p>Their second album The Reason was released in December 2003. The single "Out of Control" was made
                available for download on the band's website. Doug Robb said on the band's website: </p>
            <!-- I would add a cite property here, but the quote doesn't exist anymore on the official website. Wikipedia says it was a quote though, so I put it in the blockquote tag. -->
            <blockquote>
                <p>"A lot of it is about asking questions or questioning all that people see. It's not all about
                    religion. "Out of Control" is about that and about opening your eyes after being blinded by
                    being devoted to anything."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>"Same Direction" would reach No. 9 on the US Modern Rock chart, No. 16 on the Mainstream Rock chart
                and No. 16 on a composite World Modern Rock chart (based on the US, Germany, Sweden, Finland,
                Canada, and Australia). A year later, the Let It Out DVD collected the band's videos. "The Reason"
                was put to a popular music video on Tangle</p>

            <p>The title track was released as a single in the first half of 2004. It became a hit, reaching No. 2
                on the Billboard Hot 100, No. 1 on the US and World Modern Rock charts, No. 10 in Australia, No. 12
                in the United Kingdom and No. 15 in Germany. In Canada, it spent 21 weeks at the top, setting a new
                record for most weeks at No. 1. Meanwhile, in the United States, the album reached No. 3 on the
                Billboard 200 album chart.</p>

            <p>The band's international profile was increased by a support slot on Linkin Park's Meteora world
                tour in early 2004.</p>
